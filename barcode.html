      One of the most well known features of the former ZKO facility is the
      barcode on the wall at the entrance of ZKO1.  There have been a number
      of posts on the usenet group

      When ZK originally opened it started out as a 26 character, 7-bit ASCII
      string that read:
    </p>

      Eventually, some time in the early 1990s the wall was altered;
      repainted from orange to grey and the message changed to:
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre><code>
Customers Win
WhenWeDeliver</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time some bars rusted and were either replaced (incorrectly) or
      not at all, which resulted in its final incarnation as:

      In 2007 HP sold the ZKO Facility to a local property developer, John J.
      Flatley Co.  ZKO1 became 200 Innovative Way and the barcode was
      eventually taken down and replaced with a covered walkway.

      However, the barcode continues to live on in a new location, on the
      wall of the cafeteria.  Since the facility changed hands, ZKO has
      been renamed Nashua Technology Park.  The new barcode comes complete
      with an explanatory plaque and now reads:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
NASHUA TECH PARK
</code></pre>

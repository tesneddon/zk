title: ZKO Barcode
---

One of the most well known features of the former ZKO facility is the barcode
on the wall at the entrance of ZKO1.  Originally it started out as a 26 7-bit
ASCII string that read:

<table>
  <thead/>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1100100</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1100111</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1110100</td>
      <td>1100001</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1110011</td>
      <td>1101111</td>
      <td>1100110</td>
      <td>1110100</td>
      <td>1110111</td>
      <td>1100001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>d</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>g</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>a</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>f</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>w</td>
      <td>a</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1110010</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1101110</td>
      <td>1100111</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1101110</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1110010</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1101110</td>
      <td>1100111</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>n</td>
      <td>g</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>n</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>n</td>
      <td>g</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Eventually, some time in .... the wall was changed, repainted from orange
to grey and the  message changed to:

<table>
  <thead/>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1000011</td>
      <td>1110101</td>
      <td>1110011</td>
      <td>1110100</td>
      <td>1101111</td>
      <td>1101101</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1110010</td>
      <td>1110011</td>
      <td>0100000</td>
      <td>1010111</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1101110</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>u</td>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>m</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>n</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1010111</td>
      <td>1101000</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1101110</td>
      <td>1010111</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1000100</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1101100</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1110110</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1110010</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>n</td>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>D</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>v</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>r</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Over time some bars have rusted and been replace by the grounds keeping
staff.  In fact one bar was not replaced at all and as such the message
then read:

<table>
  <thead/>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1000011</td>
      <td>1110101</td>
      <td>1110011</td>
      <td>1110100</td>
      <td>1101111</td>
      <td>1101101</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1110010</td>
      <td>1110011</td>
      <td>0100000</td>
      <td>1010111</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1101110</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td>u</td>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>t</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>m</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>s</td>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>n</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0010 11</td>
      <td>1101000</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1101110</td>
      <td>1010111</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1000110</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1101100</td>
      <td>1101001</td>
      <td>1110110</td>
      <td>1100101</td>
      <td>1110010</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>?</td>
      <td>h</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>n</td>
      <td>W</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>F</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>l</td>
      <td>i</td>
      <td>v</td>
      <td>e</td>
      <td>r</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


Sadly, since then the barcode wall has been taken down completely and replaced
by a covered walkway:

However, there is now a new barcode in the cafeteria.....

      Since its opening in 1980 the ZKO facility has changed many times,
      starting with the opening of ZKO2 and ZKO3.  Eventually followed with
      the merging of DEC and Compaq, then later Compaq and HP.  Various groups
      within DEC were also sold off to third parties, like Rdb to Oracle and
      the compiler group to Intel.  Finally the facility was sold to a
      Nashua property developer and renamed Nashua Technology Park.

      The following collection of photos attempts to document some of these
      changes and the different groups and personalities that have inhabited
      its walls.
